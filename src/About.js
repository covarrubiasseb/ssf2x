          are created using match footage of game sets online from the world's best arcades, and the

        <p className="mt-2 ms-4 me-4 text-black"><u>How is ELO used?</u></p>

        <p className="mt-2 ms-4 me-4"><em>Super Street Fighter II X Rankings</em> uses the standard ELO rating system, along with custom modifiers to 
        change how many points a player can win/lose per game/set (defined as <em>K</em>). All players are given a Base Rating of 1800. Ratings 
        are generated from date of oldest Set to newest.</p>

        <p className="mt-2 ms-5 me-4 text-black"><u><em>The Modifiers:</em></u></p>

        <p className="mt-2 ms-5 ps-3 me-4"><u><em className="text-black">Sliding K:</em></u> For the first few games, a player has an amplified K, 
        that will decay each game until the amplifier is no longer applied. So <em>K</em>(Game 1) > <em>K</em>(Game 2) > ... > base <em>K</em> (no amplifier). 
        </p>

        <p className="mt-2 ms-5 ps-3 me-4"><u><em className="text-black">Time decay:</em></u> <em>K</em> is decayed per every year passed, so older matches 
        will lose value over time.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-2 ms-5 ps-3 me-4"><u><em className="text-black">Set Bonus:</em></u> Each Set has a Bonus <em>K</em>. It is worth double 
        the <em>K</em> of a single game, after all other modifiers are applied. This is to give value to Set results along with Game results, 
        and include them in the ratings.
