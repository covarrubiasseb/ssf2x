          Street Fighter II X competitive gaming scene in Japan, home of the world's strongest players. The rankings 
          are created using match footage of game sets online from the world's best arcades, and the  
          <a className="text-black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system" target="_blank"><em> Elo Rating System</em></a>, 
          a popular rating system for competitive games based on predicted probabilities of players winning and actual outcomes.

        <p className="mt-2 ms-4 me-4 text-black"><u>How is ELO used?</u></p>

        <p className="mt-2 ms-4 me-4">Super Street Fighter II X Rankings uses the standard ELO rating system, along with custom modifiers to 
        change how many points a player can win/lose per game/set (defined as K). All players are given a Base Rating of 1800. Ratings 
        are generated from date of oldest Set to newest.</p>

        <p className="mt-2 ms-5 me-4 text-black"><u><em>The Modifiers:</em></u></p>

        <p className="mt-2 ms-5 ps-3 me-4"><u><em className="text-black">Sliding K:</em></u> For the first few games, a player has an amplified K, 
        that will decay each game until the amplifier is no longer applied. So K(Game 1) > K(Game 2) > ... > base K (no amplifier). 
        </p>

        <p className="mt-2 ms-5 ps-3 me-4"><u><em className="text-black">Time decay:</em></u> K is decayed per every year passed, so older matches 
        will lose value over time.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-2 ms-5 ps-3 me-4"><u><em className="text-black">Set Bonus:</em></u> Each Set has a bonus K. It is worth double the K of a single game,
        after all other modifiers are applied. This is to give value to Set results along with Game results, and include them in the ratings.
